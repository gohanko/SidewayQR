# SidewayQR
SidewayQR is a minimalist QR attendance tracking application. Built using:

- Android Studio Koala (v2024.1.1)
- Jetpack Compose (with Kotlin v1.9)
- Material 3
- Material 3 Icons
- Quickie (QR Code Scanning Library)
- Retrofit

## About
The application is a frontend for the API provided by [sidewayqr-api](https://github.com/gohanko/sidewayqr-api). Basically, the API software provides the functions of a QR attendance application but this mobile application provides an Android frontend to access the API.

It is built for a group assignment for UCCD3223 Mobile Applications Development at University Tunku Abdul Rahman.

## Features
- Basic Authorisation (Login/Logout/Register/Change Password)
- View events that user either created, or joined.
- User can create/read/update/delete events.
- User can join and leave an event (join means you're interested in going).
- User can scan a QR code to attend an event (attend means you're present).

For the backend implementation, please have a look at [sidewayqr-api](https://github.com/gohanko/sidewayqr-api).
